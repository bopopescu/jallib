The original JAL compiler is released on Windows and Linux in 32-bit and 64-bit.

Versions for other OS-es can be found here but are not officially supported.

Note that the current version of the JAL compiler is v2.5 (jalv25) which supports 
PICs with more than 32 banks using a new pragma 'numbanks'. Older versions of the
JAL compiler which may be present in this directory will not support this new pragma.
