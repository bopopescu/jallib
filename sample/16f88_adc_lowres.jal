-- Description: this program shows how to use adc_hardware library. It regurlarly performs an
-- Analog-to-Digital Conversion, on channels AN0 to AN6 (see pin diagrams to know which pins are involved),
-- and sends the result through serial.
-- 
-- Notes: as output, this sample produces characters on a serial link, and uses delay library.
-- First be sure you're able to run serial and delay tests.
--
--
-- Few words about diagram: this program performs ADC on channels AN0 to AN6, so you can measure
-- any voltage source connected to these channels (no more than 5V please). To test the whole, you can
-- use a voltage divider. For AN0:
--		
--     5V
--     |
--     Z
--     Z R1        -----------
--     Z           |
--     |------ AN0-|   PIC
--     Z           |
--     Z R2        |
--     Z
--     |
--    GND
-- 
-- 
-- 		- R1=1K, R2=1K: you should get ~127 as ADC value
-- 		- R1=1K, R2=2.2K: you should get ~175 as ADC value
