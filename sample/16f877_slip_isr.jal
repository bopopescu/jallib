-- Description: This sample sends and receives SLIP (Serial Line IP) packets
--              for communication with serial data in packet form. This sample
--              will receive packets with a serial interrupt.

--
-- Notes:
-- 1. The program will send hex 01 02 03 C0 05 06 DB 08 09 0A through SLIP which
--    will be encoded into slip format then sent via the serial port.
--    If you have your PC serial port connected, you will get this hex data:
--    C0 01 02 03 DB DC 05 06 DB DD 08 09 0A C0
-- 2. Now send back an encoded message:
--    C0 01 02 03 DB DC 05 06 DB DD 08 09 0A C0 (same as above).
--    SLIP will decode the data and echo back your original message:
--    01 02 03 C0 05 06 DB 08 09 0A
